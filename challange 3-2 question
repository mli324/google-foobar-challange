The Grand Stair Case of Them All

    Each type of stair case should consist of two or more steps. No two steps are allowed to be at the same height - each type
must be lower than the previous step. All steps must contain at least one brick. A step's height is classified as the total
amount of bricks that make up that step.
    For example, when N = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build the staircase, with the first step having a height of 2 and
the second step having a height of 1: (# indicates a brick)

#
##
21

    When N = 4, still only have 1 staircase choice:

#
#
##
31
   
   But when N = 5, there are two ways:

#
#
#
##
41

32

Write a function called answer(n) that take a positive integer n and returns the number of different staircases that can be built
from exactly n bricks. n will always be at least 3 (so you can have a staircase at all), but no more than 200, because Commander
Lamba's not make of money!
